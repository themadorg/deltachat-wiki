# Why Delta Chat?

With so many messaging apps available, why should you consider Delta Chat? Here are the reasons that matter.

## You Don't Need to Trust Any Company

WhatsApp belongs to Meta — the company behind Facebook and Instagram. Their business model is built on collecting and selling personal data. Even though WhatsApp encrypts message content, it collects extensive metadata: who you talk to, when, how often, and from where.

Telegram stores most messages unencrypted on its servers. Only "Secret Chats" are end-to-end encrypted — regular chats and groups are not.

Signal is more trustworthy, but it still depends on centralized servers. If those servers go down, Signal stops working for everyone.

**Delta Chat doesn't ask you to trust anyone.** It is decentralized, open source, and built on the largest messaging network in the world. It has undergone [six independent security audits](https://delta.chat/en/help#security-audits) between 2019 and 2024 and is fully interoperable with other [chatmail apps](https://chatmail.at/clients). Your data stays on your device.

## No "Enshittification"

Many free services follow a predictable pattern: they start great, attract millions of users, and then gradually get worse as the company needs to make money. More ads, less privacy, premium features behind paywalls. This process is called **"enshittification."**

Delta Chat **cannot** follow this pattern because:
- It belongs to **no company**. It's community-driven open source software.
- No one can add ads to it.
- No one can sell your data.
- No one can shut it down.

## It's Green and Efficient

<DCFeatureCard title="Energy Efficient" icon="Leaf">

Delta Chat is remarkably energy-efficient. The Chatmail servers only store messages temporarily for delivery, consume very little power, and the app itself is built with Rust — one of the most efficient programming languages available.

The more data an app collects and processes, the more energy it uses. WhatsApp collects metadata, runs AI features, and stores data in massive data centers. Delta Chat does none of this.

You can make it even greener by choosing an email provider that runs on renewable energy. The default Chatmail server (**nine.testrun.org**) runs entirely on green electricity.

The operational costs are remarkably low: about **€500 per year** to serve around **100,000 users**. Compare that to the billions spent by Meta and Telegram on their infrastructure.

## It Works For Everyone

Delta Chat is not just for tech-savvy people. Real communities are already using it:

- A team of **21 people migrated from Matrix to Delta Chat** and reported that all members preferred the experience. Setup was smooth, the interface was familiar, and share-sheet integration worked well.
- Communities in regions with **internet restrictions** use Delta Chat because it's harder to block than centralized services.
- Organizations running their own email servers can use Delta Chat **without deploying anything new**.

## Digital Sovereignty

When you use WhatsApp or Telegram, you depend on a private company. They can change the rules anytime. They can shut down your account. They can share your data with governments or advertisers.

With Delta Chat:
- **You choose your server** — use a free Chatmail server, your organization's email, or run your own.
- **You own your data** — messages are stored on your device, not in someone else's cloud.
- **No one can cut you off** — if one server disappears, you can switch to another.

This is what **digital sovereignty** means: you control your own communication.

## It's Incredibly Easy to Set Up

Unlike many privacy-focused tools that require technical knowledge, Delta Chat is designed to be simple:

1. Download the app.
2. Tap "Create New Profile."
3. Type a name.
4. You're done.

No email address needed. No phone number. No verification code. No SIM card. No app password. You can be chatting within **60 seconds** of downloading the app.

## The Future is Federated

The original internet was designed to be **open and federated** — no single company in control. Email is one of the last surviving examples of this design. Delta Chat brings this principle back to instant messaging.

As one user put it: *"The future of communication does not have to be in the hands of large corporations. Communication can be federated, open, and community-driven. Delta Chat reminds us that it is possible."*
