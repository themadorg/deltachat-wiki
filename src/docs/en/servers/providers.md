# Choosing an Email Provider

In Delta Chat, the "server" is your email provider. You can use any provider, but some are better for chatting.

## Recommended Services
- **Chatmail**: Optimized servers specifically for Delta Chat that are very fast.
- **Posteo**: A paid service with a focus on privacy.
- **Mailbox.org**: Secure and stable German email service.

## Important Tips
Some providers like Gmail or Outlook may have limits on the number of messages or IMAP access. For the best experience, using independent services is recommended.
